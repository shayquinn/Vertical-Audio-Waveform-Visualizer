## ⚙️ Configuration

You can customize the visualizer by editing these values in the `CONFIG` object (lines 15-23):

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    barWidth: 120,              // Width of the visualization bar (in pixels)
    backgroundColor: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)',  // Background color
    borderColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3)',  // Border color
    smoothing: 0.8,             // Audio smoothing (0-1, higher = smoother)
    numBars: 40,                // Number of frequency bars
    barSpacing: 2,              // Space between bars
    barColor: '#00ff88'         // Glow effect color
};
```

## � Safety & Privacy

### Is This Script Safe? ✅

**YES** - This script is completely safe and privacy-focused:

- ✅ **No data collection** - Doesn't collect, store, or transmit any user data
- ✅ **No external requests** - Doesn't connect to any external servers
- ✅ **No tracking** - Doesn't monitor your browsing or behavior
- ✅ **No audio recording** - Only analyzes audio frequencies, never records or saves audio
- ✅ **Open source** - All code is visible and can be reviewed
- ✅ **Minimal permissions** - Only uses `GM_addStyle` (for potential future styling)
- ✅ **Local execution** - Everything runs entirely in your browser
- ✅ **Read-only access** - Only reads audio data, doesn't modify media playback

### What the Script Does Access

1. **Audio Analysis Only** - Connects to Web Audio API to read frequency data in real-time
2. **DOM Access** - Adds a single visualization container to the page (no modifications to existing content)
3. **Media Elements** - Detects `<audio>` and `<video>` elements to visualize their audio

### What the Script CANNOT Do

- ❌ Cannot record your audio or video
- ❌ Cannot access your microphone or camera
- ❌ Cannot see what you're watching/listening to
- ❌ Cannot send data to external servers
- ❌ Cannot access passwords, cookies, or personal information
- ❌ Cannot modify page content or inject ads
- ❌ Cannot track your browsing history

### Potential Concerns & Mitigations

**1. Runs on All Websites (`@match *://*/*`)**
- **Why**: Needs to work on any site with audio/video
- **Mitigation**: You can restrict this in Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey settings to specific sites
- **How**: Edit the script and change line 7 to only match specific domains:
  ```javascript
  // @match        https://www.youtube.com/*
  // @match        https://www.netflix.com/*
  ```

**2. Performance Impact**
- **Concern**: Canvas animation uses CPU/GPU resources
- **Mitigation**: Automatically pauses when tab is hidden
- **Impact**: Minimal on modern hardware (~1-2% CPU)

**3. Audio Context Conflicts**
- **Concern**: Might interfere with sites that use Web Audio API
- **Mitigation**: Uses error handling to gracefully fail if audio is already connected
- **Fallback**: Attempts visualization anyway using existing audio connection

### Best Practices

- Review the code yourself before installing (it's short and readable!)
- Only install from trusted sources (this repository or your own copy)
- Keep your browser and userscript manager updated
- Disable on sensitive sites if you prefer (banking, work sites, etc.)
- Monitor console for any unexpected `[Visualizer]` error messages

### Browser Permissions

The script uses standard web APIs available to all websites:
- **Web Audio API** - For audio frequency analysis
- **Canvas API** - For drawing visualizations
- **DOM API** - For adding the visualizer element

No special browser permissions required beyond what userscript managers normally have.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Visualizer doesn't appear:**
- Make sure the audio/video is not muted
- Check that Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey is enabled
- Open browser console (F12) and look for `[Visualizer]` messages
- Try refreshing the page

**Visualizer goes blank:**
- This has been fixed in v1.2 - make sure you're using the latest version
- Try switching tabs away and back

**No audio data detected:**
- Some sites may have audio protection that prevents visualization
- Try a different website to confirm the script works

**Concerned about a specific site:**
- You can disable the script for specific domains in your userscript manager settings
- Click the Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey icon → Dashboard → Click the script → Settings tab

## 📝 Technical Details

- **Audio Analysis**: Uses Web Audio API's AnalyserNode with FFT size of 256
- **Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas with requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps animation
- **Compatibility**: Works with all modern browsers supporting Web Audio API
- **Performance**: Automatically pauses animation when tab is hidden
